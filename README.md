## Julian Day

The Julian Day number or, more simply, the *Julian Day* (JD) is a continuous count of days and fractions thereof from the beginning of the year -4712. By tradition, the Julian Day begins at Greenwich mean *noon*, that is, at 12h Universal Time.

## Day of Year

Some data sets specify dates using the year and day of year rather than the year, month, and day of month. The *day of year* (DOY) is the sequential day number starting with day 1 on January 1st.
